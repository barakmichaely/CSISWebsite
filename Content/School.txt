Career outlook

Computing and IT professionals are in hot demand. Organizations view their IT employees as core assets and rely on them to implement and maintain the technologies that keep them competitive. The future looks bright for those preparing to enter the field as well as for those who continue to update their skills. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, job growth through 2018 will be above average in all computing fields requiring a college degree. And as Careers in Technology published by www.dice.com, points out, young IT professionals can take advantage of countless points of entry and all sorts of interesting paths for career advancement as the world continues to become more digital, more mobile and more Internet-dependent.

Over the years, Seidenberg School graduates have taken their expertise to such diverse industries as financial services, computer manufacturing and application development, telecommunications, consumer products, telemedicine, health care and pharmaceuticals, entertainment and communications, governmental agencies, and nonprofit organizations. These successful alumni lead to relationship benefits such as outstanding internship opportunites, where Pace University’s Seidenberg students gain practical, pre-professional experience through internships arranged by Pace’s outstanding Career Services Office. As a result, students become knowledgeable and self-confident professionals before they enter the workforce. These internships often lead directly to jobs either directly with the companies to whom they have been introduced, or to jobs reached through career networking opportunities that opened up for them through their internship contacts.

The school is partnered with many industries developing and offering programs like the National Coalition for Telecommunications Education and Learning (NACTEL). This collaborative program gives employees of companies like Verizon, Qwest, AT&T, and Frontier Communications as well as members of major telecommunications unions, the chance to obtain a college-level degree in telecommunications, networking, video and mobile technologies online, from anywhere in the country. The Seidenberg School offers courses to obtain degrees and advanced certificates in Software Development and Engineering or in Security and Information Assurance, the latter through courses on-site at the Bank of New York Mellon.

Additionally, opportunities exist for students who want to study, or initiate their studies, from abroad. Students in India are now able to take courses online along with counterparts in the U.S.A. and Graduate students can begin their studies in China and complete them at the university's New York City campus. The international diversity this brings to our student population adds richness to the student experience.
